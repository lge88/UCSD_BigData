      "Considering a majority of the stations are in US and very limited time, we decided only label stations and nodes in US continent, Alaska and Hawaii, and we focused on the performance of merging nodes of 9 digit node ID (i.e. the bottom level). Following this criterion, we identified 17356 stations in US. \n",

      "We adopted this widely used climate zone map from NCDC (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/maps/us-climate-regions.php). In this map the continental US is divided into 9 zones and we added two more Alaska and Hawaii. \n",
      "To label stations with zone names, we at first find the boundary of every state using this site http://econym.org.uk/gmap/states.xml. \n",
      "To simplify the task, we approximate each state with a rectangle of the maximum and minnum values of latitude and longitude of that state; all the stations within this range were labeled with that state. After this there is a manual check step to remove those incorrectly classified stations with help from an interative map http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html. This manual check is still incomplete but a part of stations have been corrected. Checked boundaries are stored at /home/ubuntu/UCSD_BigData/data/weather/boundary.pkl. \n",

If a pair of merged stations/nodes were from the same climate zone, it is a true positive result; if a pair of merged stations/nodes were from different climate zone, it is a false positive; if two stations/nodes were from the same zone but not merged, it is a false negative result; finally, it two stations/nodes were from different zones and were not merged, it is a true negative result. \n",
